In addition to Instagram, there is another platform that is mainly used by under 20-year-olds: TikTok. But what exactly is TikTok?

TikTok is a video platform for Android and iOS that was founded at the end of September 2016. With it, users can record short, self-made videos and, if desired, add music from well-known songs or film scenes to them. Many users create creative and funny videos via the app, often dancing or moving their lips in sync with the songs / scenes. The videos are usually limited to a length of 10 seconds. However, TikTok is more than just a video platform: Since users can share their videos with others, it is also a social network. TikTok, or DouYin, as it is called in China, is similar to the social media platform Instagram.
Who are the users of TikTok?

With an estimated 45.8 million downloads, TikTok was the most frequently downloaded app in the first quarter of 2018. At the beginning, the video app was particularly popular in China and Asian countries. Around 14 percent of Chinese cell phone users have installed the app. However, there are also some countries that have blacklisted the platform permanently or at least temporarily. In Indonesia and India, for example, TikTok was temporarily banned due to fear of immoral or pornographic content. For this very reason, Pakistan even blocked the app permanently on October 9, 2020. The US was also considering a ban, but for different reasons. The government under Donald Trump saw the Chinese app as an opportunity for operators to spy on users in the USA. However, a ban on the app was declared inadmissible by a court.

Meanwhile, TikTok is also becoming more and more popular in Europe and the USA. The fact that the app is mostly used by teenagers posed a problem for TikTok 2019. In the USA, the operators had to pay a fine of 5.7 million US dollars due to insufficient protection of minors and data protection. Sending and receiving private messages via the app is now only allowed to people aged 16 and over.

## What alternative is there?

One of TikTok's biggest competitors was Musical.ly, which was much better known in western countries. In late 2017, TikTok bought Musical.ly for over $ 1 billion, including the app's 200 million users. Musical.ly had essentially the same functionality as TikTok, but was founded two years earlier. In the meantime, Musical.ly has gone over to TikTok. In Germany, the twins Lisa and Lena are best known through Musical.ly.
